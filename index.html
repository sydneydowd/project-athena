    <h3>What is Project Athena?</h3>
      <p>Project Athena is a 501c3 non-profit foundation that encourages women who've endured life-altering medical setbacks to unleash the Athlete and Adventurer within and complete the journey of a lifetimeâ€”whether that's to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, cross the finish line of an Ironman Triathlon, or fall into the arms of a proud family at the end of a local 5K.</p>
