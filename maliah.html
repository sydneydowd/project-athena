  <h3 class="kerning">MEET MALIAH</h3>
    <p>Trusting in God, Trusting in Myself.
In September of 2012, when I was six and a half months pregnant, I started to lose some of my peripheral vision and as you know I have a passion for health, fitness and adventure and an even BIGGER passion for helping other women become their happiest and healthiest versions of themselves. I am so excited to be co-sponsoring Athena Angela Darch along with Project Athena to support her in her amazing journey to become an adventurer! <br></br>

I met Angela 2 years ago and she became part of my Power of 3 Tranformational Mastermind for Women. Angela is the kind of woman so many of us are always aspiring to be: she has incredible GRIT, never gives up, completely supports others even when she is in pain herself, and has a sense of humor that will keep you laughing during the toughest of times. <br></br>

Angela had a terrible accident several years ago, and after undergoing multiple highly invasive spinal surgeries, she is on her way out to San Diego to join me, her Power of 3 Team and her fellow Athenas and Project Athena Gods and Goddesses for the Harbor to Harbor Trek! A 50 mile walk in just 2 days down the coast of Southern California.
For more about Angela Darch and her INSPIRING story of tragedy to triumph, please visit her personal Athena page. Angela has survived a major medical setback and has pushed through long periods of extreme pain and debilitation to earn herself a spot as an Athena! <br></br> 

For me to be able to walk alongside Angela in the Harbor to Harbor will be an honor and 2 days I will always treasure. I hope you will help me get there and also help project Athena continue to thrive as an organization that is totally comitted to helping survivors live their adventurous lives! I need to personally raise 3K! I know that with YOUR help, I can do this! <br></br>
