      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <p>Project Athena is a 501c3 non-profit foundation that encourages women who've endured life-altering medical setbacks to unleash the Athlete and Adventurer within and complete the journey of a lifetimeâ€”whether that's to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, cross the finish line of an Ironman Triathlon, or fall into the arms of a proud family at the end of a local 5K.<br></br>

Project Athena provides travel expenses, entry fees, coaching, equipment and, most importantly, the encouragement and inspiration to help strong, amazing women make that life-affirming transition from Survivor to Athlete.</p>

        <p>In a nutshell, you (a very cool person for even being on this part of the website!) can help us raise money for these amazing women in one of three ways: Enter Your Own Local Event. Choose a race that's close to your heart and race on behalf of the Project Athena Foundation. (IE a marathon, a triathlon, a climb). Come along with the Project Athena Racing Team on one of our adventures and race alongside us on behalf of the Project Athena Foundation! Our next events will be the Grand Canyon Trek, the San Diego Harbor to Harbor Trek and the Florida Keys.</p>

  <p>"All of us have had our 'chutes' to deal with in life", explains Project Athena's Founder and World Champion Adventure Racer Robyn Benincasa. "Project Athena is all about showing other Survivors the way to the 'ladders' and helping them inspire and amaze themselves on that climb back up. Probably the most important thing we give our Athenaship Recipients is hope, and a vision of what's possible. Doctors cure the body...Project Athena cures the spirit."</p>
